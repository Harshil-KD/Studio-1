Project: Student Activity Manager

Summary: 
    The system idea of student Activity manager is a student academics and activity management system that enables educational institutions to manage student data in real-time and help parents to manage their children’s time. The system would allow users to view, add, and manage student data, including personal information, academic records, and schedule. It would also allow users to manage student enrolment in classes, extra-curriculum activities and track overall progress. The system would generate reports on student data, such as academic performance, and schedule, which can be customized to show data for specific time periods, student groups, and academic departments. 
    
    The proposal for this system will present a novel concept that will be comprehensively elucidated in terms of the data inputs, queries it can handle, the intended users, and the distinguishing features that set it apart from existing products.
    
    By using SQLite, we can provide a robust and scalable solution that is both efficient and cost-effective. Also, it has been flexible enough to be customised later as per the user’s demand.
